## My process

I started building by completing the HTML code as i want it to be

I started the CSS in desktop mode and later made the page reponsive to various sizes



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to add the needing styling to my page using CSS.

### Continued development

Going forward i will be doing more CSS challenges before going further into learning and practising JavaScript

### Useful resources
